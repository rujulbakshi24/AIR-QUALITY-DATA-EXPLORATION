# Air Quality Data Exploration
# Project Description
This project analyzes air quality data across Indian cities using Python. The analysis focuses on pollutant trends, AQI (Air Quality Index) distribution, and city/state-level comparisons. The insights derived from the datasets help identify the most polluted areas, dominant pollutants, and seasonal trends, providing actionable recommendations for improving air quality.

The project utilizes data visualization, statistical analysis, and clustering techniques to extract meaningful conclusions.

# Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:

City Day Air Quality Dataset

Contains city-wise daily measurements of air pollutants and AQI.
Key columns: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, AQI, City, AQI_Bucket.

Indian Cities Database

Provides geographic and administrative details for Indian cities.
Key columns: City, State, Lat, Long.

# Objective
The objective is to explore the datasets to:

Understand pollution levels across cities and states.
Identify trends in air quality over time.
Detect dominant pollutants for each region.

# Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language for analysis.
Libraries Used:
pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: Numerical operations.
matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.
scikit-learn: Clustering analysis.
